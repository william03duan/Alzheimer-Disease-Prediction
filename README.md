# Modeling For Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Predictive Analysis

## Overview

This study developed a model to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnoses based on patients' demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, and symptoms. Additionally, we analyzed all predictive factors included in the model to identify their influence on Alzheimer's diagnosis outcomes, aiming to uncover factors that are more likely to contribute to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we analyzed patients' health factors to explore whether health-related behaviors (such as smoking and drinking) play a decisive role in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains the training and test data for Alzheimer's disease diagnoses.
-   `data/02-analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains a series of fitted models we used. 
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contain the R scripts used to simulate, download, test, and clean data.

## Data Retrieval
