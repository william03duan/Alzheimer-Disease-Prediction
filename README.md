# Modeling For Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Predictive Analysis

## Overview

This study developed a model to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnoses based on patients' demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, and symptoms. Additionally, we analyzed all predictive factors included in the model to identify their influence on Alzheimer's diagnosis outcomes, aiming to uncover factors that are more likely to contribute to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we analyzed patients' health factors to explore whether health-related behaviors (such as smoking and drinking) play a decisive role in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `Raw Data` contains the training and test data for Alzheimer's disease diagnoses.
-   `Data Visualization Charts` contains the figures generated for data analysis (mainly visulization) part.
-   `ML Models` contains a series of fitted models we used.
-   `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` contains data cleaning, summary statistics (for numerical variables), and data visulization charts (code) (histogram, countplots,boxplots...)
-   `Paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `research question 2.Rmd` contain the R scripts used to make GLM model for assessing significant factors for answering research question two.

## Data Retrieval

We obtained the raw data from Kaggle, "Classification of the Alzheimer's Disease" competition, available at: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/classification-of-the-alzheimers-disease/data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/classification-of-the-alzheimers-disease/data).
